		<h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="files/cv-master.pdf">CV</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Math Notes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="files/equivalence.pdf">Equivalence of Categories</a>: Notes on equivalence of categories, including a proof of the theorem that states that two categories are equivalent if there is a functor between them that is full, faithful and essentially surjective on objects.</li>
			<li><a href="files/abelianization.pdf">Abelianization of Groups</a>: Notes on the commutator subgroup of a group. I really went into this to fully understand the example in my adjoints notes about an adjunction between the forgetful and free functors between the category of abelian groups and the category of groups.</li>
			<li><a href="files/adjoints.pdf">Adjoint Functors</a>: Notes on adjoint functors. Following the chapter on Adjoint Functors in Tom Leinster's Basic Category Theory, I look at adjunctions from the Hom-Set Definition, units counits and initial objects and show that they are equivalent.</li>
			<li><a href="files/yoneda.pdf">The Yoneda Lemma</a>: Notes on the Yoneda Lemma, beginning with the notion of representable functors and how adjunctions give rise to representables.</li>
			<li><a href="files/godel.pdf">Mathematical Logic and Model Theory</a>: Notes from a course I took of the same name taught by Professor Colin McLarty.</li>
